# IMDB-Database
In this project, we

•	Built an "IMDB" database system which was able to manage massive datasets, including 100k+ movie/ actor/ comments records in database and designed a friendly front-end user interface.

•	Implemented B+ tree indexing, which resulted in accelerating SQL queries speed to more than 1000 times faster than linear traversal. 

• Also built a front end page to add movies/actors/comments into database and get the query from the database.
